    },
    { 
      "title": "Can you describe your experience with responsive design and cross-browser compatibility?", 
      "content": "Responsive design is a core part of my front-end workflow. I build mobile-first layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox, and rely on media queries and relative units like em, rem, and vw/vh to ensure fluid, adaptive design across screen sizes. For cross-browser compatibility, I test regularly in Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge, and use tools like BrowserStack and built-in device emulators to catch issues early. I also apply progressive enhancement and fallback styles to maintain a consistent, accessible experience across devices and browsers."

    { 
      "title": "What's the most complex front-end application or feature you've built or contributed to?", 
      "content": "One of the most complex front-end applications I've worked on was an interactive HTML Canvas photo cropper. Users could upload or take a photo, crop their face, and overlay it onto one of several animated GIFs. The cropped face and selected animation were sent to a backend service using FFmpeg, and the final image was delivered via email, text, and a custom redemption page. Another notable project was a Phaser.js game for the Nissan Heisman House, where users caught footballs in a virtual Sentra sunroof - complete with increasing difficulty and a live leaderboard. I've also contributed to large-scale CMS projects like Humana Virtual Neighborhood, built on Umbraco with integrated event calendars, RSVP features, and Zoom/Facebook meetups. Across all these, I've handled just about everything from real-time interactivity (via WebSockets and Electron) to CMS-driven content delivery and performance optimization."
